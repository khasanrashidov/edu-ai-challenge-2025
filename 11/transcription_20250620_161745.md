What brings you in here today?

I'm just having this really sharp pain in my chest, and I'm scared. I think I'm having a heart attack.

Oh wow, that must be really scary. When did this pain start?

About three days ago.

Three days ago? Okay. And where exactly in your chest do you feel it?

It's kind of right here, right over my heart, I think. That's where it's the worst.

Okay. And what kind of pain is it? Is it more like a dull pressure or a sharp pain? How would you describe it?

I'd say it's a sharp pain.

A sharp pain? Okay. So it started three days ago. Has it been coming and going, or has it been constant?

It just lasts for a few seconds and then it goes away.

Okay. Does the pain come on when you're doing any activities, or when does it usually come on?

It's usually worse when I'm coughing or lying down.

Okay. Does it improve with any positional changes or anything you do? Does anything help?

When I lean forward, it actually does get better, if I think about it.

Okay. Has this ever happened to you before?

No, it hasn't.

On a scale of one to ten, with one being the least amount of pain and ten being the worst, how would you rate it?

I'd say a six out of ten.

Okay. Does the pain move anywhere in your chest, or does it stay in the same spot?

I think it kind of goes to my neck sometimes.

Okay. Do you have any other symptoms like shortness of breath, dizziness, anything like that?

No, I don't.

Any palpitations?

Nope.

Other than that, have you been having any other symptoms besides the pain?

No, nothing else. Just these short episodes of pain that last a couple of seconds.

Okay. Have you tried any medications that have helped the pain?

Yes, I took some Tylenol, and that did help. I took it once yesterday.

Any recent injuries to the area? Any falls or anything like that?

No, I haven't.

Any headaches, nausea, vomiting, fevers, or chills?

No.

Any cough, runny nose, or other viral symptoms?

Not right now, but I did have the flu last week. I had a fever, a runny nose, a bit of a cough, and I was feeling very tired. But not anymore. I'm okay now.

Have you had any dizziness or fainted at all?

No.

Have you noticed any weakness or numbness?

No.

In terms of your past medical history, do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other diagnoses?

No, I'm a pretty healthy 25-year-old.

Do you take any medications?

I sometimes take Tylenol.

Any allergies?

No.

Any previous surgeries?

No surgeries.

Do you have any family history of heart conditions, cancers, or anything like that?

Yes, my father had a heart attack two weeks ago, and he passed away. I'm worried I'm having a heart attack too.

It was just two weeks ago?

Yes.

I'm so sorry to hear that. It must be a really difficult time for you right now.

Yes.

So you're worried you might be having a heart attack as well?

Yes.

Okay. We can definitely do some tests to see what's going on. I just have a few more questions, and then I'll explain the management and what we'll be doing for you moving forward.

Currently, do you work at all?

No, I'm a student. Well, I have a part-time jobâ€”I work as a postman.

Where are you a student? What do you study?

I'm studying engineering at Western.

And where do you currently live? Do you live in the city, student housing, an apartment, or a home?

I live with my mom now, in a house.

Do you drink alcohol?

I drink occasionally, maybe one or two drinks on the weekends.

Any recreational drug use, like marijuana or cocaine?

No.

Do you smoke?

No.

Okay, those are all the questions we have for you today. It must be really difficult and scary for you right now, but we'll make sure to keep you updated on what's going on.

What we can do is get you an ECG to see how your heart is functioning, and then get some blood work if needed. Right now, I would say try not to worry too much and wait to see what the tests show.

Thank you.

You're welcome.
